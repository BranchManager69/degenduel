These are indeed excellent and highly relevant technical questions that get to the core of a robust Solana v2 integration. Based on our work and the documentation, here are those questions formulated for research or a discussion with developers:

1.  **Optimal Way to Get 64-Byte Secret Key from v2 `CryptoKeyPair` for External Encryption:**
    *   "When using the Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.generateKey`) to create an extractable Ed25519 `CryptoKeyPair` for Solana v2, what is the most robust and officially recommended method to derive the 64-byte secret key (32-byte private key seed + 32-byte public key) that's compatible with older systems or encryption routines expecting the `@solana/web3.js` v1 `Keypair.secretKey` format? Is the common approach of exporting the public key as `'raw'`, the private key as `'pkcs8'`, slicing the last 32 bytes from the PKCS#8 output for the private seed, and then concatenating them, the standard practice?[1] Or do `@solana/keys` or `@solana/signers` offer a more direct utility for this specific 64-byte extraction from a `CryptoKeyPair` that we might have overlooked?[2]"
    *(This seeks to confirm if the manual derivation is the accepted v2 method or if a more direct helper exists in the newer libraries.)*

2.  **Commitment Handling for Proxied Methods in Custom RPC Layers (like `solana-compat.js`):**
    *   "When building a compatibility layer that might proxy calls to either a v1-style engine or directly to a v2 RPC client created with `createSolanaRpc` (from `@solana/rpc` or `@solana/kit`), what's the best practice for managing and passing `commitment` levels? Specifically, if `createSolanaRpc` is initialized with a default commitment (which appears to be 'finalized' if unspecified [3]), do subsequent individual calls like `rpc.getBalance(address).send({ commitment: 'confirmed' })` reliably override that default?[4] How should a compatibility layer best abstract this for methods like `getBalance`, `getLatestBlockhash`, etc., to ensure explicit commitment is honored consistently through both potential v1 and v2 execution paths, especially considering advice like matching preflight and `getLatestBlockhash` commitments?[5]"
    *(This aims to clarify the interaction of default versus per-call commitments in v2 and best practices for abstraction layers.)*

3.  **`@solana/keys` `generateKeyPair()` vs. Web Crypto `subtle.generateKey()` for Extractability:**
    *   "Does the `generateKeyPair()` function from `@solana/keys` consistently return a `CryptoKeyPair` whose `privateKey` and `publicKey` `CryptoKey` objects are created with `extractable: true` by default? The documentation for `@solana/keys` does not show an `extractable` parameter for `generateKeyPair()` [2], unlike `createPrivateKeyFromBytes(bytes, extractableFlag)`.[2] If it doesn't default to extractable, and doesn't offer a parameter, is direct use of `crypto.subtle.generateKey({ name: 'Ed25519' }, true, ['sign', 'verify'])` [6] the intended path when a new, extractable `CryptoKeyPair` is required? This aligns with our experience where direct Web Crypto API usage was necessary to ensure extractability for a utility script."
    *(This seeks to confirm the default behavior of `@solana/keys`' `generateKeyPair()` regarding extractability and validate the workaround.)*

4.  **Best Practices for Rate Limiting & Batching RPC Calls with v2 SDK:**
    *   "For applications making numerous RPC calls in sequence, such as fetching balances for many accounts or performing sanity checks like in our `populate_managed_wallets.mjs` script, what are the recommended v2 SDK patterns or community best practices for handling RPC rate limits?[7] Beyond simple `setTimeout` delays, are there preferred queueing libraries, or strategies like built-in SDK support for request batching, exponential backoff, or circuit breakers that integrate well with the async nature of v2 calls (e.g., `rpc.someCall().send()`) to manage concurrency and avoid hitting node limits, as suggested by general RPC optimization guides?[8]"
    *(This looks for advanced rate-limiting strategies and whether the v2 SDK offers specific tools or if third-party solutions/patterns are common.)*

5.  **Handling `blockhash` and `lastValidBlockHeight` in v2 `TransactionMessage` with `@solana/compat`:**
    *   "When using `@solana/compat`'s `fromLegacyTransactionInstruction` to convert v1 instructions for a v2 `TransactionMessage`, how should `recentBlockhash` and `lastValidBlockHeight` (which are properties of a v1 `Transaction` object) be incorporated into the v2 `TransactionMessage` using `setTransactionMessageLifetimeUsingBlockhash`? Given that blockhashes expire relatively quickly (around 151 slots or ~60-90 seconds [5, 9]), and the recommendation is to use the most recent blockhash possible [9], should we always fetch a *new* blockhash and its `lastValidBlockHeight` when constructing the v2 `TransactionMessage`, rather than attempting to use or convert the blockhash information from the original v1 `Transaction` if it's still considered recent enough?"
    *(This addresses the correct handling of transaction lifetime parameters when converting from v1 to v2, focusing on whether to reuse or refresh blockhash information.)*
