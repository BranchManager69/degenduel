## Issue Analysis

This error indicates a module import problem with the Discord notification service. Key points:

1. The system is trying to import from `/home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/discordNotificationService.js`

2. The error "Cannot find module" indicates the file doesn't exist at that location or there's an import path issue

3. This is related to the fix we just made for the discordNotificationService in the Services Down issue
   - We fixed the service by addressing the missing `fancyColors` import
   - But the service is now located at `/home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/discord/discordNotificationService.js`
   - The system is still trying to import from the old location

4. The import is happening in `index.js` but the service has likely been moved to a subfolder structure (services/discord/)

This is most likely a result of a recent refactoring that moved the Discord service into a subdirectory, but not all import references were updated.

## Fix Plan

1. Check the current location of the Discord notification service:
   ```bash
   # Confirm the current location of the Discord notification service
   ls -la /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/discord/discordNotificationService.js
   ```

2. Check the import statement in index.js:
   ```bash
   # Find the import statement in index.js
   grep -n "discordNotificationService" /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/index.js -A 5 -B 5
   ```

3. Fix the import path in index.js:
   - Update the path from `./services/discordNotificationService.js` to `./services/discord/discordNotificationService.js`
   - Use Edit to update the file with the correct path

4. Check for any other files that might be importing the Discord service from the old location:
   ```bash
   # Find all files that import discordNotificationService
   grep -r "import.*discordNotificationService" --include="*.js" /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel
   ```

5. Update any other references that might be using the old path

6. Test the fix by restarting the service:
   ```bash
   cd /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel && npm run pm2:restart-all &
   ```

7. Verify the Discord notifications are working by checking the logs for successful notifications

This issue highlights the importance of carefully updating all references when refactoring and moving files, especially in a large codebase with multiple service dependencies.
