## Issue Analysis

There's an error during the initialization of the Jupiter client, which is part of the SolanaEngine service. The key issue is in the service registration process:

1. The log shows: `{"type":"string","isInstance":false,"hasConfig":false,"dependencies":["solana_engine_service"]}`
2. The registration is attempting to register `jupiter_client` as a string value and not as a proper service instance
3. The error occurs at the ServiceManager.register call in jupiter-client.js (line 591)

The error is similar to issue #1 - the jupiter_client is being registered but is not an instance of BaseService as required. Despite this error, the Jupiter client appears to continue initialization, fetching the token list from the Jupiter API. This suggests that while there's a registration error, the client may still partially function.

## Fix Plan

1. Examine the JupiterClient implementation:
   ```bash
   # Check the Jupiter client implementation
   cat /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/solana-engine/jupiter-client.js | grep -n "initialize\|register\|BaseService" -A 10 -B 5
   ```

2. Fix the JupiterClient service registration:
   - Modify the class to properly extend BaseService if it doesn't already
   - Fix the ServiceManager.register call in the initialize method
   - Ensure that an actual instance is registered, not a string name

3. Check if there's a backup or alternative implementation:
   ```bash
   # Check if there's a backup file
   ls -la /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/solana-engine/jupiter-client.js* 
   ```

4. If a backup exists (jupiter-client.js.bak), compare the two to identify any recent changes:
   ```bash
   # Compare with backup if it exists
   diff /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/solana-engine/jupiter-client.js /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/solana-engine/jupiter-client.js.bak
   ```

5. Review the initialization sequence in the SolanaEngine service to understand the full context:
   ```bash
   # Check SolanaEngine initialization
   cat /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/solana-engine/solana-engine.js | grep -n "initialize.*Jupiter" -A 15 -B 5
   ```

6. Test the fix by restarting the service and verifying the Jupiter client initializes properly:
   ```bash
   cd /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel && npm run pm2:restart-all &
   ```

7. Check for any dependencies that rely on the Jupiter client to ensure they initialize properly after the fix.
