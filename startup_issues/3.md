## Issue Analysis

This issue shows a cascading failure affecting two services:

1. **token_detection_service** fails to initialize because:
   - Warning shows "Jupiter client not initialized, will retry later"
   - This is directly related to Issue #2 - the Jupiter client registration error
   - Even though the Jupiter client appears to fetch token data, it may not be properly registering as an initialized service

2. **token_enrichment_service** fails to initialize because:
   - It depends on token_detection_service which failed
   - This demonstrates the dependency chain in the service architecture

The root cause appears to be the Jupiter client initialization issue. If the Jupiter client isn't properly registered and initialized as a service, the token detection service cannot initialize, which in turn causes the token enrichment service to fail.

## Fix Plan

1. First, fix Issue #2 (Jupiter client registration error) as it's the root cause

2. Examine the token detection service to understand how it depends on the Jupiter client:
   ```bash
   # Look at the token detection service implementation
   cat /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/market-data/tokenDetectionService.js | grep -n "Jupiter\|jupiter" -A 10 -B 5
   ```

3. Verify dependency configuration in the token detection service:
   ```bash
   # Check the initialization method and how it handles dependencies
   cat /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/market-data/tokenDetectionService.js | grep -n "init\|initialize" -A 20 -B 5
   ```

4. Check how token enrichment service depends on token detection service:
   ```bash
   # Look at token enrichment service dependencies
   cat /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel/services/token-enrichment/index.js | grep -n "detection\|detect" -A 5 -B 5
   ```

5. Consider implementing better error handling or fallback mechanisms:
   - In the token detection service, provide more detailed error information when Jupiter client isn't available
   - Consider making token_enrichment_service able to operate in a limited capacity without token_detection_service

6. After fixing the Jupiter client issue, test the dependency chain by restarting services:
   ```bash
   cd /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel && npm run pm2:restart-all &
   ```

7. Monitor logs to verify both services initialize correctly after the Jupiter client is fixed:
   ```bash
   tail -f /home/branchmanager/.pm2/logs/degenduel-api-out.log | grep -E "TokenDetection|TokenEnrichment|Jupiter" 
   ```

**Note**: The success of this fix depends on successfully addressing Issue #2. This is a dependency chain issue where fixing the Jupiter client registration should cascade to fix both token services.
