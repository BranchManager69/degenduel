  // Polyfill WebSocket for Node.js (use ws package)
  import WebSocket from 'ws';
  global.WebSocket = WebSocket;

● This code snippet shows a WebSocket polyfill being applied to the global scope in the
  contestWalletService.js file.

  What it's doing:

  1. The service imports the ws package (a WebSocket implementation for Node.js)
  2. It then assigns this implementation to the global WebSocket property with global.WebSocket = 
  WebSocket

  This is a polyfill technique that makes the Node.js environment work with browser-like WebSocket
  APIs. In browsers, WebSocket is a built-in global object, but Node.js doesn't have this by
  default. By assigning the imported ws package to global.WebSocket, the code ensures that any
  subsequent code can use WebSocket as if it were in a browser environment.

  This allows the contestWalletService to use WebSocket connections for real-time monitoring of
  wallet balances on the Solana blockchain without having to adjust for the Node.js environment in
  every place WebSockets are used.

  The service likely needs this because:
  1. It monitors Solana accounts in real-time via WebSocket connections
  2. It may be using libraries that expect a browser-like WebSocket implementation
  3. It provides a consistent WebSocket interface across the service's implementation

  This is a common pattern when working with WebSockets in Node.js, especially when interfacing with
   blockchain networks that provide WebSocket APIs.

> Okay something is up here. 

  Honestly I have so many different questions and I don't even know where to begin so I don't want 
  to touch anything or break anything right now but I have a lot of questions let's just say that

  OK so let me ask you a couple questions and these may be dumb but they may be smart I don't know 
  so this I believe is one of the only if not the only of those that use my websocket stuff that 
  felt like it had to require the polyfill technique and that's very curious so I'm thinking I'm not
   doing something right or at least by best practices so I'm curious is it because of the following
   which is around line 958 onto approximately 1209 and beyond (maybe)... I believe that this might 
  be the only if not one of the only it's probably very very very very very few services who 
  actually create web sockets or listen to web sockets to itself meaning within the same server I 
  mean isn't this like an event kind of a thing rather than a websocket to itself thing but I don't 
  know you tell me

                              logApi.info(`${formatLog.tag()} ${formatLog.info('Falling back to 
  traditional polling for wallet balances')}`);

                      this.websocketSubscriptions.connectionRetries = 0;

  polling for wallet balances')}`);

              }
          });
      }

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about their WebSocket implementation in contestWalletService.js, specifically 
  why this service requires a WebSocket polyfill when other services don't. They're questioning if 
  the approach of having a service create a WebSocket connection to itself (to the same server) is 
  the right architecture, versus using an event-based system.

  Let me analyze the key points:

  1. The service is using a WebSocket polyfill (global.WebSocket = WebSocket) which allows Node.js 
  to use browser-like WebSocket APIs
  2. The service has a method initializeWebSocketMonitoring() that sets up WebSocket connections
  3. The service creates a connection to ws://localhost:port/api/v69/ws (their unified WebSocket 
  server)
  4. This appears to be a service-to-service communication pattern where the contest wallet service 
  connects to the unified WebSocket server running on the same machine
  5. The purpose is to monitor Solana account balances in real-time

  The architecture is unusual because:
  - The service is connecting to itself/the same server via WebSocket instead of using direct 
  internal communication
  - It needs the polyfill specifically to handle WebSocket client operations in Node.js
  - It's creating a WebSocket connection to localhost (same machine)

  This is indeed a somewhat unusual pattern and there are potentially more efficient approaches. Let
   me explain the issues and alternatives.

● You're right to be curious about this pattern. The code in contestWalletService.js is quite
  unusual from an architectural perspective. Let me break down what's happening and explain some
  alternatives:

  What's Happening Here

  This service is using WebSockets in an unusual way:

  1. It polyfills WebSocket at the global level (global.WebSocket = WebSocket)
  2. It then connects as a WebSocket client to your own unified WebSocket server running on the same
   machine (ws://localhost:3004/api/v69/ws or similar)
  3. It's essentially using WebSockets for "self-communication" within your own application

  Why This Is Unusual

  This approach has several architectural oddities:

  1. Same-Process Communication via Network Protocol: The service is using a network protocol
  (WebSockets) to communicate within the same Node.js process or at least the same machine. This
  adds unnecessary overhead.
  2. TCP Loopback: Every WebSocket message goes through the TCP stack, even though both the sender
  and receiver are on the same machine.
  3. Duplicated Logic: You have to maintain both WebSocket server and client logic for what's
  essentially internal communication.

  Better Alternatives

  1. Event Emitters: For truly internal communication, Node.js's built-in EventEmitter system would
  be much more efficient:
  import { EventEmitter } from 'events';
  const accountUpdateEmitter = new EventEmitter();

  // One part of your code emits events
  accountUpdateEmitter.emit('account:update', { address, newBalance });

  // Another part listens for them
  accountUpdateEmitter.on('account:update', (data) => { /* handle update */ });
  2. Shared State & Observers: For state management across services, a simple observer pattern with
  a shared state store would work.
  3. Message Queue: If you need persistence or communication between separate processes, a
  lightweight message queue would be more appropriate.

  Why It Might Be Like This

  There could be reasons this architecture evolved this way:

  1. Unified Interface: Maybe you wanted all components (including browser clients) to use the same
  WebSocket API for consistency.
  2. Incremental Development: Perhaps it started as external communication and gradually turned into
   self-communication.
  3. External Service Migration: It might have been designed to eventually move to separate
  services/machines.

  Refactoring Approach

  If you want to refactor this:

  1. Create a direct communication layer for service-to-service interaction
  2. Keep the WebSocket interface for external clients only
  3. Consider a shared EventEmitter for internal account updates

  The polyfill is needed because your service is acting as a WebSocket client, and the native
  WebSocket API exists in browsers but not in Node.js. Other services probably don't need it because
   they're not creating WebSocket client connections.

  Would you like me to outline a more specific refactoring approach for this particular case?

> OK this is going to take a pretty precise change set but I think that we're getting closer to the 
  issues here at hand. Is it possible that you could do a quick scan for any similarly services that
   might do the same thing I don't know how you find them without looking through each one perhaps 
  you could just quickly do a scan for the polyfill thing

✻ Thinking…

  I'll search for other services that might be using the same WebSocket polyfill pattern. This would
   likely involve looking for similar import patterns or the global.WebSocket assignment.

  Let me search for:
  1. Services that import 'ws' package
  2. Services that set global.WebSocket
  3. Services that might be using WebSocket clients to connect to their own server

  This should help identify if there are other places with similar architecture.

● I'll scan for other services that might be using a similar WebSocket polyfill pattern. Let's look
  for imports of 'ws' and assignments to global.WebSocket:

     transfers:')} ${error.message}`);
           return false;

● Based on my search, I can provide a clearer analysis:

  WebSocket Usage Findings

  I've scanned your codebase and found:

  1. contestWalletService.js is the only service that:
    - Assigns to global.WebSocket (the polyfill)
    - Connects to your internal WebSocket server at '/api/v69/ws'
    - Creates self-communication via WebSockets
  2. helius-client.js also uses WebSockets, but:
    - It uses WebSockets correctly to connect to an external Helius API
    - It doesn't need the global polyfill (it just imports and uses ws directly)
    - It's doing legitimate WebSocket client work to a third-party service

  The Unique Issue

  Your contestWalletService.js is unique in implementing this problematic pattern:

  1. It's the only service connecting to its own WebSocket server
  2. It's the only one doing self-communication via network protocol
  3. It's the only one that felt the need to globally polyfill WebSocket

  The helius-client.js uses WebSockets properly - connecting to an external API (Helius) to receive
  real-time updates about blockchain events. This is a legitimate and efficient use case for
  WebSockets.

  Recommended Changes

  For contestWalletService.js specifically:

  1. Replace the WebSocket self-communication with EventEmitter:
    - Create a central event bus for account updates
    - Have your WebSocket server emit to this bus when it receives updates
    - Have contestWalletService listen to this bus instead of connecting via WebSocket
  2. Remove the global WebSocket polyfill:
    - Once you're using EventEmitter, you won't need WebSockets for internal communication
    - If you need WebSockets for other purposes, import and use without global assignment

  This would give you a cleaner architecture with less overhead and fewer potential points of
  failure.

> OK this explains a lot. First of all we've got our work cut out for us as far as fixing the 
  contest wallet service to use the correct approach and second of all I do intend to somehow have 
  you help me make some sort of a systemic change that would allow me higher visibility into the web
   socket activities or status specifically between the server and outside external services or apis
   like helius. It's hard for me to explain what type of thing I'm looking for right now to be 
  honest with you in that regard but I can tell you it's not going to be just your run of the mill 
  oh I'll make a new type of api or whatever for you and yeah that's not going to work for me just 
  think about that this this is almost like I need an ergonomic way that I can nicely just witness 
  what that specific helios to server connection has going on inside of it... I think it's fine to 
  just start with that one for now rather than because I don't even have any other api services in 
  mind that I'm thinking of but that would be an excellent example to start with so what just runs 
  through your mind when I'm talking about this kind of stuff. I mean theoretically it could be just
   a separate utility script that I just run on the command line and somehow I get patched in 
  exactly to witness literally like what it sees and the commute like all 2 way communication but I 
  just don't even know if that's possible and I don't know the implications of it and I don't even 
  know if that's good practice

  Something you should know though and this will be the bulk of your individual task work until I 
  give you clearance to proceed, I need you to find understand and be able to teach, because you 
  understand it so well, the service event based system that we already have. I am positive that we 
  have something along the lines of the event emitter central event bus that you are looking for but
   I just don't have any clue or remember where it is or what it is right now

✻ Thinking…

  Let me analyze the request and understand what's needed:

  1. First, understand the existing event-based system in the codebase that could serve as a central
   event bus
  2. Then teach/explain this system so it's clear how it could be used for the WebSocket 
  communication in contestWalletService.js
  3. Later (after clearance), possibly look at creating a way to monitor WebSocket activity with 
  external services like Helius

  Let me start by searching for event emitter implementation or similar patterns in the codebase:

● I'll focus on understanding the existing event-based system in your codebase. Let's search for
  potential event emitter implementations or service-to-service communication patterns:

                        contest_name: contest.contest_name || `Contest #${contest.id}`,

                    });
                    // Non-critical error, continue execution

  ⎿      serviceEvents.on('contest:created', this.handleContestCreated.bind(this));

             switch(action) {

● Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive explanation of the event-based
  communication system in your codebase:

  DegenDuel's Event-Based Communication System

  Your codebase already has a robust event-based system implemented through
  utils/service-suite/service-events.js, which is exactly what we need for the contestWalletService
  refactoring.

  Core Components:

  1. serviceEvents Singleton:
    - This is a Node.js EventEmitter that serves as the central event bus for your entire
  application
    - Defined in utils/service-suite/service-events.js
    - It's a singleton, so all services use the same instance
    - Has a raised limit of 50 listeners (more than Node's default of 10)
  2. Standard Event Types:
    - SERVICE_EVENTS constants define standardized event names used throughout the application
    - Events are well-categorized (service, contest, user, transaction, system)
    - Examples: contest:created, token:price_update, system:alert
  3. BaseService Integration:
    - Every proper service extending BaseService automatically gets access to events via this.events
    - BaseService constructor has: this.events = serviceEvents;
    - Services can both emit and listen for events
  4. ServiceManager Event Tracking:
    - The ServiceManager listens for service lifecycle events
    - It tracks service state changes via events like service:started, service:error, etc.

  How Services Use Events:

  Services throughout your codebase are already using this event system:

  1. Emitting Events:
    - Services emit events when important things happen
    - Example from contestEvaluationService: serviceEvents.emit(SERVICE_EVENTS.CONTEST_COMPLETED, 
  {...})
    - These events include relevant data for listeners
  2. Listening for Events:
    - Services subscribe to events they need to know about
    - Example from discord-interactive-service: serviceEvents.on('contest:created', 
  this.handleContestCreated.bind(this))
    - When an event is emitted, all listeners receive it immediately

  Perfect for contestWalletService Refactoring:

  This existing system is exactly what we need for the contestWalletService refactoring:

  1. Rather than using WebSockets to self-communicate:
    - The unified WebSocket server could emit events when it receives account updates:
  serviceEvents.emit('account:update', { address, newBalance })
    - contestWalletService can listen for these events: serviceEvents.on('account:update', 
  this.handleAccountUpdate.bind(this))
  2. Advantages of this approach:
    - Zero network overhead (events are in-memory)
    - No need for global WebSocket polyfill
    - Follows your established architectural pattern
    - Simpler code with fewer failure points

  Implementation Strategy:

  When you're ready to refactor, we can:

  1. Add new event types in SERVICE_EVENTS for account balance updates
  2. Modify the unified WebSocket server to emit these events
  3. Update contestWalletService to listen for events instead of making its own WebSocket connection
  4. Remove the global WebSocket polyfill and self-connection code

  This would fully leverage your existing architecture and fix the unusual WebSocket usage.

  Would you like me to elaborate on any aspects of this event system or how specifically to apply it
   to contestWalletService?

> Excellent work truly truly excellent work here this is something that I will actually really focus
   on for a while I may even copy paste this and frame it because it's such a valuable information 
  that you've compiled here for me now this is going to be the Modis operandi for the next day or 2 
  for me okay we are going to do exactly and continue to flesh out exactly what you've got described

  Okay but I do want to keep you going while you are smoking hot on just really solving issues and 
  diagnosing issues here so one more question before we begin the updates maybe two questions...

  First of all, can you please just for my information tell me as possible as as as complete as 
  possible or just you know I don't want you to go through spending like tons of time doing this but
   if it's really nice and easy for you I'd like an enumeration of all of the different types of 
  events that it currently emits like the unified web socket server itself, is it a service? And 
  does it okay so the reason I'm asking if it's a service itself is, because the base service 
  obviously has things that all services can do and uniform, but if this is just the websocket 
  emitting events randomly then or not randomly but loosely I should say then I don't know I would 
  just change the way I look at stuff so can you please tell me all of the different events that it 
  currently emits so just in other words as simply as possible, what events right now are currently 
  in our code base being powered by web socket connections to external services? And by that I mean 
  HELIUS since that's literally the only one that we do this type of thing for

● Based on my thorough analysis, here's a comprehensive overview of the WebSocket events in your
  system:

  WebSocket Events in DegenDuel

  External Service WebSocket Connections

  Your system currently has one main external WebSocket connection to the Helius API:

  1. Helius WebSocket (helius-client.js)
    - Connects to Helius's WebSocket endpoint
    - Listens for two main event types:
        - accountNotification - Real-time updates to account data
      - logsNotification - Real-time transaction logs (especially for token transfers)
    - These external events are processed by handleWebSocketMessage and
  handleTokenTransferNotification
    - The client forwards relevant data by calling custom handlers on token transfers

  Events Emitted Based on External WebSocket Data

  When Helius sends WebSocket data, your system emits these events through serviceEvents:

  1. Token Price Updates
    - Event: token:price_update
    - Source: helius-pool-tracker.js
    - Data: tokenAddress, poolAddress, price, changePercent
    - Generated from Helius pool data
  2. Token Transfers
    - Internal callbacks via tokenTransferHandlers (not using serviceEvents)
    - The Helius client notifies registered handlers when token transfers occur
    - These handlers process the data internally rather than emitting global events
  3. Pool Data
    - Event: pool:data_updated
    - Source: pool-data-manager.js
    - Data: tokenAddress, poolCount, source

  Unified WebSocket Server

  Your unified WebSocket server (v69) is not a formal service in the BaseService hierarchy. Instead,
   it:

  1. Provides a centralized WebSocket server for client connections
  2. Registers event handlers to broadcast data to connected clients
  3. Contains a Solana PubSub handler for account monitoring

  The unified WebSocket server handles these events:

  1. Market Data: market:broadcast
  2. Terminal Data: terminal:broadcast
  3. Vanity Dashboard: vanity:dashboard_update
  4. System Status: system:status
  5. Wallet Balance: wallet:balance_update

  Solana PubSub Functionality

  The unified WebSocket server also implements a WebSocket proxy for Solana account monitoring:

  1. Clients subscribe to specific Solana accounts via the unified WebSocket
  2. The server creates a direct WebSocket connection to Solana RPC for each account
  3. When account updates arrive from Solana, they're forwarded to subscribed clients
  4. Account data is broadcasted as account-update events to clients

  This explains why contestWalletService is the only service creating its own WebSocket connection -
   it's connecting to the unified WebSocket server to monitor Solana accounts, effectively doing the
   same thing that clients would do through their WebSocket connection.

  Key Finding

  The root issue is that contestWalletService is using WebSockets to connect to itself (via the
  unified WebSocket server) for Solana account monitoring, when it should instead:

  1. Either connect directly to Solana's WebSocket RPC (like helius-client does)
  2. Or use the event system to receive account updates directly

  The simplest solution would be to modify the unified WebSocket server to emit internal
  serviceEvents when account updates arrive from Solana (account:update), and have
  contestWalletService listen for these events instead of making a WebSocket connection.

  Does this explanation help clarify the current WebSocket event structure in your system?
