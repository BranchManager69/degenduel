# Service Architecture Improvements

This PR improves our services to better comply with the BaseService architecture pattern and fixes several issues identified in the service architecture audit.

## Changes

### 1. TokenEnrichmentService

1. **Circuit Breaker Integration**
   - Added proper circuit breaker checks throughout the service
   - Added `isCircuitBreakerOpen()` helper method
   - Added circuit breaker status event emission

2. **Safe Stats Access**
   - Fixed unsafe stats access with proper null checks
   - Replaced direct increment with safe assignment patterns
   - Added defensive checks for queue length access

3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Fixed circular reference issues in error logging
   - Enhanced error details with structured logging
   - Added stack trace info to debug logs

4. **Enhanced Event Emission**
   - Added service status events for better monitoring
   - Added error events with safe error information
   - Improved heartbeat with safe stats serialization

### 2. DexScreenerCollector

1. **Fixed Duplicate Method**
   - Removed duplicate `getTokensByAddressBatch` method
   - Consolidated batch processing logic

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Fixed circular reference issues in error logging
   - Improved error message formatting

### 3. JupiterClient

1. **BaseService Integration**
   - Refactored to properly extend BaseService
   - Added initialize(), stop(), and performOperation() methods
   - Implemented proper service lifecycle management

2. **Circuit Breaker Support**
   - Added circuit breaker integration throughout all operations
   - Added isCircuitBreakerOpen() method
   - Added proper error recovery mechanics

3. **Safe Stats Management**
   - Added custom stats tracking for token counts and API operations
   - Used safe stat access patterns to prevent null reference errors
   - Implemented safe error handling to prevent circular references

4. **Service Manager Integration**
   - Added proper service registration with dependencies
   - Added event emission for service lifecycle events
   - Enhanced status reporting for monitoring

5. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Used safe-service.js utilities for consistent error logging
   - Prevented circular references in error objects
   - Added detailed error information without deep object nesting

### 4. Created safe-service.js Utility Module

1. **Reusable Utility Functions**
   - Added safe() for null-safe property access
   - Added inc() for safe counter increments
   - Added set() for safe property assignment
   - Added logError() for circular-reference-free error logging
   - Added isCircuitOpen() for consistent circuit breaker checks
   - Added safeStats() for safe stats object serialization

## Documentation

1. Created TOKEN_ENRICHMENT_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md with:
   - Current status assessment
   - Detailed enhancement plan
   - Implementation steps
   - Best practices for service architecture compliance

## Testing

1. **Service Audit Results**
   - TokenEnrichmentService: improved from 7 to 9 (out of 10)
   - JupiterClient: improved from 5 to 9 (out of 10) 

2. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Created jupiter-client.test.js to verify compatibility between old and new implementations
   - Ensured all public methods maintain the same interface and behavior
   - Added performance comparison between implementations

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar fixes to other services:
   - HeliusClient
   - DexScreenerClient (remaining fixes)
   - TokenMonitorService
   - TokenRefreshScheduler

2. Extend safe-service.js utility functions:
   - Add more defensive programming patterns
   - Enhance error handling with categorization
   - Add performance monitoring utilities

3. Create comprehensive service architecture testing harness:
   - Automate service compliance checks
   - Add load testing for circuit breaker validation
   - Create service resilience tests

## Dependencies

- No new dependencies added
- Removed unnecessary frontend UI dependencies from package.json
