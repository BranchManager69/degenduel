## Gold Standard Services

These services follow all best practices and should be used as reference implementations:

1. **TokenWhitelistService** (Score: 9)
   - Path: `./services/tokenWhitelistService.js`
   - Description: Manages token whitelisting for platform security and validation

2. **WalletGenerationService** (Score: 9)

   - Description: Generates and manages wallet keypairs for the platform

3. **AchievementService** (Score: 9)
   - Path: `./services/achievementService.js`
   - Description: Manages user achievements, awards, and progress tracking

4. **ReferralService** (Score: 9)
   - Path: `./services/referralService.js`
   - Description: Handles user referral system including tracking and rewards

## Services Needing Immediate Attention

These services have the most critical issues and should be prioritized for refactoring:

1. **VanityWalletService** (Score: 3)
   - Path: `./services/vanity-wallet/vanity-wallet-service.js`
   - Issues:
     - Doesn't call super.initialize()
     - Doesn't use handleError method
     - May not implement circuit breaker pattern
     - Has circular dependencies with index.js
     - May not properly clean up resources in stop method

2. **MarketDataService** (Score: 4)
   - Path: `./services/market-data/marketDataService.js`
   - Issues:
     - Doesn't call super.initialize()
     - Creates new PrismaClient instance
     - Has unsafe stats access
     - Has missing await in promise handling
     - May not properly clean up resources

3. **DiscordNotificationService** (Score: 4)
   - Path: `./services/discordNotificationService.js`
   - Issues:
     - Doesn't call super.initialize()
     - Doesn't use handleError method
     - Has unsafe stats access
     - May not emit service events
     - May not properly clean up resources

4. **TokenDexDataService** (Score: 4)
   - Path: `./services/token-dex-data-service.js`
   - Issues:
     - Doesn't call super.initialize()
     - Doesn't use handleError method
     - May not implement circuit breaker pattern
     - May not emit service events
     - May not properly clean up resources

## Client Services Requiring Pattern Change

These services don't follow the BaseService pattern but should be refactored to use a consistent client service pattern:

1. **DexScreenerClient** (Score: 2)
   - Path: `./services/solana-engine/dexscreener-client.js`

2. **JupiterClient** (Score: 2)
   - Path: `./services/solana-engine/jupiter-client.js`

3. **HeliusClient** (Score: 2)
   - Path: `./services/solana-engine/helius-client.js`

## Common Patterns to Fix

### 1. Missing super.initialize() Call

```javascript
// INCORRECT
async initialize() {
  try {
    // Create database connection and other initialization
    // ...
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
    return false;
  }
}

// CORRECT
async initialize() {
  try {
    // Always call parent initialize first
    await super.initialize();
    
    // Then do service-specific initialization
    // ...
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    // Proper error handling
    await this.handleError(error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 2. Unsafe Stats Access

```javascript
// UNSAFE - Stats might be undefined
this.stats.operations.total++;
this.stats.operations.successful++;

// SAFE - Check before accessing
if (this.stats && this.stats.operations) {
  this.stats.operations.total++;
  this.stats.operations.successful++;
}
```

### 3. Missing handleError Usage

```javascript
// INCORRECT
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  logApi.error("Operation failed", error);
}

// CORRECT
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  logApi.error("Operation failed: " + error.message);
  await this.handleError(error); // Integrates with circuit breaker
}
```

### 4. Creating New PrismaClient

```javascript
// INCORRECT
this.db = new PrismaClient({
  datasourceUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL
});

// CORRECT
import prisma from '../../config/prisma.js';
// ...
this.db = prisma;
```

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate fixes**:
   - Update all services to call `super.initialize()`
   - Fix unsafe stats access patterns
   - Replace direct PrismaClient instances with the singleton

2. **Short-term improvements**:
   - Add proper handleError usage to all services
   - Fix circular dependencies in vanity-wallet and admin-wallet modules
   - Ensure all services properly clean up resources in their stop methods

3. **Long-term refactoring**:
   - Create a ClientService base class for API clients
   - Standardize event emission across all services
   - Consider implementing a service factory pattern

## How to Use This Document

1. Use `service-architecture-audit.json` for programmatic access to service compliance data
2. Reference the gold standard services when implementing new services
3. Prioritize fixing services with the lowest compliance scores
4. Run the `service-audit.sh` script periodically to track progress
