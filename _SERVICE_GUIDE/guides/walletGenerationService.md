# Wallet Generation Service (walletGenerationService.js) Documentation

This document contains diagrams and analysis for `services/walletGenerationService.js`, focusing on its purpose, key generation methods, encryption techniques, and its migration status towards v2 Solana SDKs.

## Overview

This service is likely responsible for generating new Solana wallets (keypairs), potentially encrypting their private keys, and storing them. Its interaction with other services (like the refactored `LiquidityService`) and its own direct Solana dependencies need to be examined.

*(Analysis to be added as files are reviewed)*
