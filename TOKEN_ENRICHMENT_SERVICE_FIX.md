# Token Enrichment Service Fix

## Issue 1: Service Registration
The TokenEnrichmentService was failing to initialize with the error:
```
TypeError: dependencies is not iterable
```

This occurred in the ServiceManager.register() function when trying to iterate through the dependencies. The issue was that the service was registered incorrectly:

```javascript
// Register with service manager
serviceManager.register(this.name, this);
```

In this call, `this` (the service instance) was being passed as the dependencies parameter, but the ServiceManager expected an array of dependency service names.

### Solution
Fixed the service registration code to explicitly pass the dependencies array:

```javascript
// Register with service manager with explicit dependencies
const dependencies = [SERVICE_NAMES.TOKEN_DETECTION, SERVICE_NAMES.SOLANA_ENGINE];
serviceManager.register(this.name, dependencies);
```

This matches the dependencies defined in the service metadata in `service-constants.js`.

## Issue 2: Missing Database Fields
The TokenEnrichmentService was attempting to use column fields that didn't exist in the Prisma schema, causing database errors when trying to write to those fields.

### Solution

1. **Added Missing Columns to Tokens Model**
   Added the following fields to the `tokens` model in `schema.prisma`:
   - `first_discovery` - When a token was first discovered
   - `last_discovery` - When a token was most recently discovered
   - `discovery_count` - How many times the token has been discovered
   - `metadata_status` - Status of metadata enrichment process

2. **Migrated Database**
   Created a new migration named `add_token_enrichment_fields` that adds these fields to the database.

3. **Updated Code to Use Existing Fields**
   Modified `tokenEnrichmentService.js` to use existing fields or JSON storage for metadata:
   - Using `last_refresh_attempt` instead of a non-existent `last_enrichment_attempt`
   - Using `last_refresh_success` instead of non-existent `last_enrichment` field
   - Storing enrichment errors and attempt counters in the `refresh_metadata` JSON field
   - Updated the re-enrichment check logic to look for enrichment timestamps in the metadata JSON

## Verification
After applying the fixes and running the migration:
```
âœ” Generated Prisma Client (v6.6.0) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 1.93s
```

The service is now able to use these fields correctly without Prisma validation errors.

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always pass dependencies as an array of service names when registering services
2. Ensure service registration is consistent with service metadata
3. Always verify database schema compatibility before deploying service updates
4. Use schema-driven development to ensure database fields exist before code tries to use them
5. Consider adding defensive checking for JSON field access
