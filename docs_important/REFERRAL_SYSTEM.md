# DegenDuel Referral System

## Overview

DegenDuel's referral system is a comprehensive solution for tracking, analyzing, and rewarding user referrals. Think of it as a sophisticated tracking system that follows the entire journey of a user from the moment they click a friend's referral link to when they become an active user themselves.

### Simple Example
When Alice shares her referral link with Bob:
1. Bob clicks the link on Twitter
2. System tracks that click came from Twitter
3. Bob creates an account
4. Alice gets credit for referring Bob
5. Both Alice and Bob can earn rewards

### Data Collection Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant DB as Database
    participant R as Rewards

    U->>F: Clicks Referral Link
    F->>F: Stores Session ID
    F->>A: POST /analytics/click
    A->>DB: Save Click Data
    
    U->>F: Signs Up
    F->>A: POST /analytics/conversion
    A->>DB: Update Click Record
    A->>DB: Create Referral
    A->>R: Process Rewards
    R-->>U: Reward Notification

    Note over F,A: All data points tracked<br/>for marketing insights
```

## How It Works (Non-Technical)

### 1. The Referral Link
Think of a referral link as a special package that contains:
- Who shared it (the referrer)
- Where it was shared (Twitter, Discord, etc.)
- What campaign it's part of (if any)

### 2. Click Tracking
When someone clicks the link, we track:
- Where they came from (like clicking from Twitter vs. Discord)
- What device they're using (phone vs. computer)
- When they clicked
- A unique "session ID" (like a digital fingerprint)

This helps us understand:
- Which platforms bring the most users
- What times people are most likely to join
- Which devices our users prefer

### 3. Conversion Tracking
When someone creates an account:
- We match their signup to the original click
- This tells us how long people take to decide to join
- We can see which sources bring the most active users

## Core Features

### 1. Referral Code Generation
- Personalized codes based on username/nickname
- Fallback to random generation if needed
- Guaranteed uniqueness through collision handling
- Maximum length of 20 characters
- Uppercase format for consistency

### 2. Click Tracking
Captures detailed information about referral link clicks:
- Source of the click (direct, contest, profile)
- Landing page
- UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign)
- Device information
- Browser details
- IP address (for fraud prevention)
- User agent
- Session tracking
- Timestamp

### 3. Conversion Tracking
Monitors the entire referral journey:
- Click to signup conversion
- Qualification status
- Reward distribution
- Time to convert
- Session persistence

### 4. Analytics & Reporting
Provides comprehensive analytics:
- Click-through rates
- Conversion rates by source
- Device/browser statistics
- Geographic data
- UTM campaign performance
- Reward distribution metrics
