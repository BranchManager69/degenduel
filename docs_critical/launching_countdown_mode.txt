● Maintenance Mode uses middleware that checks system availability, allowing admin users and critical services to
  bypass restrictions while blocking standard services. Admins can enable/disable maintenance via dedicated API
  endpoints in routes/admin/maintenance.js. Status endpoints return 503 when active. Settings are stored in the
  database and include duration and timestamps.

> How could we begin planning for a Launch Countdown mode?  This, unlike Maintenance Mode, will not need to restrict 
  API access whatsoever but rather display to non-admin/superadmin visitors (both authenticated and unauthenticated) 
  who try to access the landing page a simple countdown instead of any of the main content.

● A Launch Countdown mode could be implemented as:

  1. New middleware similar to maintenanceMiddleware but only affecting frontend routes
  2. New database settings in system_settings table for countdown config (time, message)
  3. Admin endpoints in routes/admin to control countdown settings
  4. Frontend detection of countdown mode via a status endpoint

  Unlike maintenance mode, all API services would remain functional, with the middleware only intercepting landing
  page requests to show the countdown instead. The implementation would need minimal backend changes since it's
  primarily a frontend display concern.

> What if i wanted it to automatically work for every page rather than just the landing page.  Could I implement it 
  into a common component, like Header or something?

● Yes, implementing it in a common component like Header would be ideal:

  1. Create a countdown configuration endpoint in the API
  2. Fetch countdown status in your app's root component or layout
  3. Display the countdown overlay when active, blocking all page content
  4. Store countdown configuration in system_settings table

  This approach would automatically apply the countdown to every page since the Header or layout component is
  rendered across all routes. The backend would just need to provide the configuration data without restricting any
  API functionality.

● Backend updates for countdown mode:

  1. Add countdown fields to system_settings table
  2. Create GET endpoint for countdown status
  3. Add admin routes for managing countdown settings
  4. Create countdown middleware (optional, for SSR)
  5. Update status.js routes to include countdown info
  6. Add countdown database schema in prisma
